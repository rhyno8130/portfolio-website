            <h1>A Little Bit About Myself</h1> 
            <p>
                Hello friends, my name is Ryan Bradford and I am a baker and full-stack programming student at Career Foundry. I graduated
                with a BA in Recreation Therapy from University of North Carolina Wilmington in 2013. After graduation I chose to change the path
                I has set myself on years before and followed my passion for cooking and baking, an experience I will forever be thankful for. 
                After an amazing decade in the industry, I decided to blaze a new personal trail yet again and go down the path of computer programming. 
                <br>
                <br>
               Throughout my life I have always been enamored with how everything in life works, always asking myself questions
               like: "Why do our beverege glasses sweat?", "What about yeast makes bread rise?", and "How do computers function?".
               There are countless questions that I've pondered, some I've found the answers to, others I'm still searching for. 
               My latest endeavor is to understand how to code and program both front and back end. I feel the future for the profession
               is blindingly bright and it satiates my hunger for knowledge and learning new skills. I look forward to one day contributing
               new and groundbreaking ideas to the field. Hello World, and watch out, I'm on my way!
            </p>
